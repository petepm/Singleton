# Singleton composition notes

## Verse composition

We have a repeating 1-4-3 kick pattern

The melodic pattern is A-A-B-C-D A-B-C A-B-C-D A-B-C
                       1-4-3-1-4 3-1-4 3-1-4-3 1-4-3

What is the pattern of rest between each small unit?

    12-7-9-10-13 TODO

What is the pattern of rest between each group?

Pattern of length of the units? 5-5-4

Pattern in the subdivisions used in the units? Currently all 16ths.

Notes in the key

    1-4-5-1

Maybe use heartbeat intervals to carry this into the rhythm.

Durations between snare hits:

* Root: 8 16th notes
* 7.25 semitones: 3.04 / 4 * 8 ~ 6.1 ~ 6 + 1/8 -- 128ths -- an inversion
* 0.71 semitones: 2.08 / 2 * 8 ~ 8.3 ~ 8 + 1/3 -- 48ths

Subdivisions used for kicks:

* Root: 4 16ths
* 1/4 / 2.08 = 0.12 -- 1/8th notes

1-7-5

Write verse and chorus totally from vocals first!


## Intro modules

Let's give these names and arrange where they go.

1. Strait up cyclic -- normal one from before
2. Triplet transition
3. Slide up and down lead-in
4. Chromatic chicken transition
5. Aqua marine 2-3-5-4-3
6. Sequenced aqua marine transition
7. Nuno triplets (little Jack)
8. Minor 3rd chromatic shuffle
9. Han Valen ascension
10. Country Blinkin

We must now arrange a "melody" or story from these.


## Heartbeat chord

* Root
* 7.25 semitones -- 3.04 ratio halved
* 0.71 semitones -- 2.08 ratio halved
* 6.53 semitones -- 2.92 ratio halved


## Idea combination during composition

The initial riffs were very simple.


## Breakdown desolation part

1. 8 chugs then 21 8ths: 4 * (5 + 1/4) * 1/8 = 4 * (5/8 + 1/32) = 4 * 21/32
2. 7 chugs then 20 8ths: 4 * 5 * 1/8
3. 9 chugs then 19 8ths: 19 / 4 * 1/8 = 4 * 19/32
4. 9 chugs then 24 8ths: 4 * (24/32) = 4 * (6/8)

How many triplets for the buildup?

18 clusters of 3, then 13 clusters of 3, then 1 lone triplet.

The geet fill is 11 clusters of 3 triplets, then the last long note.


## Tempo changes during build-up

Measures/beats since start, time, tempo:

1. 1458 / 3:22.361: 73 (sharp drop)
2. 1460 / 3:23.952: 77.771 (linear)
3. 1462 / 3:25.401: 87.707 (linear)
4. 1464 / 3:26.683: 99.429 (linear)
5. 1466 / 3:27.826: 110.543 (linear)
6. 1467 / 3:28.309: 137.520 (linear)
7. 1468 / 3:28.745: 137.469 (linear)
8. 1470 / 3:29.595: 144.924 (linear)
9. 1472 / 3:30.354: 171.190 (linear)
10. 1478 / 3:32.213: 216 (linear; back to normal!)


## Misc concepts

* Intro riff gets more complicated each iteration, even when it comes back
  later in the song.
* Orbin yell 1-2-3-4 with the stick count in.
