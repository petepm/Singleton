## Verse composition

We have a repeating 1-4-3 kick pattern

The melodic pattern is A-A-B-C-D A-B-C A-B-C-D A-B-C
                       1-4-3-1-4 3-1-4 3-1-4-3 1-4-3

What is the pattern of rest between each small unit?

    12-7-9-10-13 TODO

What is the pattern of rest between each group?

Pattern of length of the units? 5-5-4

Pattern in the subdivisions used in the units? Currently all 16ths.

Notes in the key

    1-4-5-1

Maybe use heartbeat intervals to carry this into the rhythm.

Durations between snare hits:

* Root: 8 16th notes
* 7.25 semitones: 3.04 / 4 * 8 ~ 6.1 ~ 6 + 1/8 -- 128ths -- an inversion
* 0.71 semitones: 2.08 / 2 * 8 ~ 8.3 ~ 8 + 1/3 -- 48ths

Subdivisions used for kicks:

* Root: 4 16ths
* 1/4 / 2.08 = 0.12 -- 1/8th notes

1-7-5

Write verse and chorus totally from vocals first!


## Intro modules

Let's give these names and arrange where they go.

1. Strait up cyclic -- normal one from before
2. Triplet transition
3. Slide up and down lead-in
4. Chromatic chicken transition
5. Water world 2-3-5-4-3
6. Sequenced major transition
7. Nuno triplets (little Jack)
8. Minor 3rd chromatic shuffle
9. Han Valen ascension 


## Heartbeat chord

* Root
* 7.25 semitones -- 3.04 ratio halved
* 0.71 semitones -- 2.08 ratio halved
* 6.53 semitones -- 2.92 ratio halved


## Idea combination during composition

The initial riffs were very simple.


## Misc concepts

* Intro riff gets more complicated each iteration, even when it comes back
  later in the song.
