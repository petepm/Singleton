It's like the seeds falling from a tree
Many will never even sprout

Constantly peering
Out the corner of my eye
For a little blue circle
On a pinned tab

That time it's perpetually Pinkerton
It's life in Singleton

Is it really so much of a line to cross?

Good is such an enemy of perfect
Good was good enough for me
But not her

Love is but a choice
Not a chance

But we all must try to get
The best we can get
Evolution has made this yet

I've been kind of happy for a little while
Could use some heartbreak

And another round of silent self-sabotage
Ensures the confrontation comes from the other side

And the other one
My experiment in unnatural happiness
Against all instincts

One I got away from
Another a wave
And always breaking
But onto my sandbox

One trip to the pulled pork parade
And I'm cured of my affection
