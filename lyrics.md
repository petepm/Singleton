# Lyrics

## Verse 1

If only I could get this stupid song done
Finally, would be happy
Uh
Function with its own rate of change
Uh
Or complex imaginary

## Chorus 1

I've slid down that slippery slope before
Five-got to kiss
AH!
Will not fail until I fail the next time
And it's coming back to


## Verse 2

This cliche bout quantity of fishies
The sea
Got me
No arm floatees
Ow hey
That old rod bent off awkwardly
But it's baited masterfully

And the memories assaulting sleep
And dreams
The cringe in heaps
Stacked on my Zs
They're terrifying me
Eternally


## Chorus 2

I always thought that I would miss you
But now it's in a different way
Count down the times I would not try
Or fall on my face
And now it's coming back to you


## Post-chorus

I see you like your fucking punk songs
I'd sit and play them all day long
Then lay all night
On a pull-out couch
Sad like a miniature ice cube tray
I'd take anything to make you feel


## Intro return

No use 'round pretty girls
Now I'm down on a knee
Like a nut that fell from a tree
A fallen seed
No most won't succeed
Bunglin' all the way
Left that sheltered path where some say
Let's get married


## Slow intro

Slow down now baby
I'm just not ready for that kind of commitment
You want to share passwords?
I'll show you what I can do


## Solo

Hey baby
Isn't this an impressive guitar solo
I swear
I don't take music that seriously


## Solo 2 (background vox)

I see you like your fucking prog songs
I'd sit and play them all night long
Then lay all day next to Lentil Soup
One evil dragon that I can't slay
My curse of nothing good to say


## Intro outro

I simply shouldn't care
Be a part of the weird
Undeclare any air of self
Awareness and don't spare this pulled pork parade
Tugging all the way
It must be your last time in love
So get married


## Misc lyrics

It's like the seeds falling from a tree
Many will never even sprout

Constantly peering
Out the corner of my eye
For that pale blue dot
On a pinned chromed tab

That time it's perpetually Pinkerton
It's life in Singleton

Is it really so much of a line to cross?

Good is such an enemy of perfect
Good was good enough for me
But not her

Love is but a choice
Not a chance

But we all must try to get
The best we can get
Evolution has made this yet

I've been kind of happy for a little while
Could use some heartbreak

And another round of silent self-sabotage
Ensures the confrontation comes from the other side

And the other one
My experiment in unnatural happiness
Against all instincts

One I got away from
Another a wave
And always breaking
But onto my sandbox

One trip to the pulled pork (double-P) parade
And I'm cured of my affection
But creeping back
It's death by a thousand paper cuts

All the compliments with caveats
My voice of an angel
Nope the cousin of an angel
It's not as fluid as Jeff Buck...
Leading into the next
So different by similar in all the worst ways

Sure, plenty of fish in the sea
But I got no boat
Rod's getting old
May as well become a master of baiting

Sometimes I think that I don't need to worry
Because things are going okay
But then start worrying that if I stop worrying
Things will start to be not okay
Because worrying is keeping them that way


## Misc ideas

* Last time in love
* The way it has to be
* Short, pale, and ugly
* Pain fades and each disaster only gets one line
* Happiness as a side effect
* Tiny ice cubes
* Need that energy, that variance
* If you don't have problems, like being ugly or awkward, you may not need to
  get involved in some good shit, since things will just go so well for you.
* Thought it was unfortunate that I'd have to get married someday, and it would
  be so nerve-wracking.
* Lots of "i" in this song. Is this a math joke?!?!?!
* Not enough courage to try for the connection I want
* A couple dragons
* Compliments with caveats
* Left the shelter
* Won't let it bug me since I won't live that long anyway
