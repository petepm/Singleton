# Lyrics

## Verse 1

If only I could get this stupid song done
Finally, would be happy
Uh
Function with its own rate of change
Uh
Or complex imaginary

## Chorus 1

I've slid down that slippery slope before
Five-got to kiss
AH!
Will not fail until I fail the next time
And it's coming back to


## Verse 2

Hm cliche bout quantity of fishies
The sea
Got me
No arm floatees
Old rod bent and waiting
A master baiting furiously

And the memories assaulting sleep
And dreams
The cringe in heaps
Stacked on my Zs
They're terrifying me
Eternally


## Chorus 2

I always thought that I would miss you
But now it's in a different way
Count down the times I did not try
Or fall on my face
And now it's coming back to you


## Post-chorus

I see you like your fucking punk songs
I'll sit and play them all day long
Then lay there all night
On a pull-out couch
Like a tiny ice cube tray
Cursed with nothing normal to say
I'd say anything to make you feel


## Intro return

Freeze up round pretty girls
Like I fell out a tree
Fallen seed
No most will not take
Struggling all the way
Missed the path where some say
Hey babe let's get married


## Intro outro

I simply shouldn't care
Be a part of the weird in the town of the pink
Aware inside something is driving
Tugging all the way
If this is your last time in love
Then get married


## Misc lyrics

It's like the seeds falling from a tree
Many will never even sprout

Constantly peering
Out the corner of my eye
For that pale blue dot
On a pinned chromed tab

That time it's perpetually Pinkerton
It's life in Singleton

Is it really so much of a line to cross?

Good is such an enemy of perfect
Good was good enough for me
But not her

Love is but a choice
Not a chance

But we all must try to get
The best we can get
Evolution has made this yet

I've been kind of happy for a little while
Could use some heartbreak

And another round of silent self-sabotage
Ensures the confrontation comes from the other side

And the other one
My experiment in unnatural happiness
Against all instincts

One I got away from
Another a wave
And always breaking
But onto my sandbox

One trip to the pulled pork (double-P) parade
And I'm cured of my affection
But creeping back
It's death by a thousand paper cuts

All the compliments with caveats
My voice of an angel
Nope the cousin of an angel
It's not as fluid as Jeff Buck...
Leading into the next
So different by similar in all the worst ways

Sure, plenty of fish in the sea
But I got no boat
Rod's getting old
May as well become a master of baiting

Sometimes I think that I don't need to worry
Because things are going okay
But then start worrying that if I stop worrying
Things will start to be not okay
Because worrying is keeping them that way

If I could only finish this song
All my problems would be gone


## Misc ideas

* Last time in love
* The way it has to be
* Short, pale, and ugly
* Pain fades and each disaster only gets one line
* Happiness as a side effect
* Tiny ice cubes
* Need that energy, that variance
* If you don't have problems, like being ugly or awkward, you may not need to
  get involved in some good shit, since things will just go so well for you.
* Thought it was unfortunate that I'd have to get married someday, and it would
  be so nerve-wracking.
* Lots of "i" in this song. Is this a math joke?!?!?!
* Not enough courage to try for the connection I want
* A couple dragons
* Compliments with caveats
* Left the shelter
