# Lyrics

## Verse 1

If only I could get this stupid song done
Finally, would be happy
Q
Function with its own rate of change
T
Or complex imaginary

## Chorus 1

I've [three] slid [point] down
That [one] slippery slope be-four [one]
Five-got to kiss
Pi!
Will not fail until I fail the next time
And it's coming back to


## Verse 2

This cliche bout quantity of fishies
The sea
Got me
No arm floatees
Ow hey
That old rod bent off awkwardly
But it's baited masterfully

And the memories assaulting sleep
And dreams
The cringe in heaps
Stacked on my Zs
They're terrifying me
Eternally


## Chorus 2

I always thought that I would miss you
But now it's in a different way
Count down the times I would not try
Or fall on my face
And now it's coming back to you


## Post-chorus

I see you like your fucking punk songs
I'd sit and play them all day long
Then lay all night
On a pull-out couch
Sad like a miniature ice cube tray
I'd take anything to make you feel


## Intro return

No use 'round pretty girls
Now I'm down on a knee
Like a nut that fell from a tree
A fallen seed
No most won't succeed
[No qt 3.14]
Bunglin' all the way
Left that sheltered path where some say
Let's get married


## Slow intro

Slow down now baby
I'm just not ready for that kind of commitment
You want to share passwords?
I'll show you what I can do


## Solo

Hey baby
Isn't this an impressive guitar solo
I swear
I don't take music that seriously


## Solo 2 (background vox)

I see you like your fucking prog songs
I'd sit and play them all night long
Then lay all day next to Lentil Soup
One evil dragon that I can't slay
My curse of nothing good to say


## Intro outro

I simply shouldn't care
Be a part of the weird
Undeclare any air of self
Awareness and don't spare this Pinkerton pulled pork parade
Tugging all the way
It must be your last time in love
So get married
