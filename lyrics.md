It's like the seeds falling from a tree
Many will never even sprout

Constantly peering
Out the corner of my eye
For that pale blue dot
On a pinned chromed tab

That time it's perpetually Pinkerton
It's life in Singleton

Is it really so much of a line to cross?

Good is such an enemy of perfect
Good was good enough for me
But not her

Love is but a choice
Not a chance

But we all must try to get
The best we can get
Evolution has made this yet

I've been kind of happy for a little while
Could use some heartbreak

And another round of silent self-sabotage
Ensures the confrontation comes from the other side

And the other one
My experiment in unnatural happiness
Against all instincts

One I got away from
Another a wave
And always breaking
But onto my sandbox

One trip to the pulled pork (double-P) parade
And I'm cured of my affection
But creeping back
It's death by a thousand paper cuts

All the compliments with caveats
My voice of an angel
Nope the cousin of an angel
It's not as fluid as Jeff Buck...
Leading into the next
So different by similar in all the worst ways

Sure, plenty of fish in the sea
But I got no boat
Rod's getting old
May as well become a master of baiting
